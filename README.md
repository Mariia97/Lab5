# Human Activity Recognition Smartphones
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

#### The R script analysis.R in this repository does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create data set for analysis.
2. Computes mean and standard deviation for each variable.
3. Uses label to name the activities in the data set.
4. Creates independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity across each subject.
